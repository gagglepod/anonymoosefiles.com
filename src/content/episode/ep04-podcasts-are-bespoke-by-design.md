## Podcasts are Bespoke by Design

When considering the creation of a new podcast there are generally two options available to you: Copy an existing format, or create your own special format. But how do you create a format that is unique enough to be different but not too unique that it scares listeners away? The answer is in understanding what existing formats are in your niche and how bespoke design thinking can make you stand out.
