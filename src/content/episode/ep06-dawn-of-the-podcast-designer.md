## Dawn of the Podcast Designer

Podcast design is an act of communication. However, a common mistake made by most podcasters is thinking of ourselves as only audio communicators. We’re fortunate to speak the audio language fluently, but we need to be able to translate that thinking into visual and performance mediums as well. In other words, we need to be bilingual but not in the way you would expect.

### Notable Quotes

_"Think about the way the same two lines can be spoken, but have very different meanings: 1. [EXCITED] Let’s Eat Grandpa!! 2. [SOFT] Let’s Eat, Grandpa. The first way makes it sound like your Grandpa IS the meal -- while the second way is an invitation for your Grandpa to join you for a nice meal. The same spoken words just performed very differently. This is what I mean about being bilingual."_<br />
