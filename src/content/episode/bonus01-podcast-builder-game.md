# Podcast Builder Game (Bonus)

To become an Audio Experience (AX) designer, you need to exercise your creativity. One idea is to use a game like the Podcast Builder Game to create a podcast in 30 minutes or less.

## Here is how to play the game:

- The host invites 2-4 guests to create 10 design requirements (5-10 minutes).
- Each of the players spends some time creating a rough podcast idea (5-10 minutes).
- Everyone shares their rough podcast idea with the host asking clarifying questions.
- Everyone then explores each otherâ€™s creation (Pros/Cons, Open Forum).
- If there needs to be a winner, the host, the guests, or the audience decides.
